\section{RESUME}
Studying electronic engineering was a straightforward decision driven by my passion about music, particularly electric guitar and electronic synthesizers.
Alongside the academic courses focused on designing analog and digital IC for processing and control systems, my interests fall on programmable embedded devices, like microcontrollers, FPGAs and CPU architectures.
I attended two internships at the DAVE embedded systems of Pordenone (Italy) to get in touch with real world applications and industry standard methodologies.
I worked with Zynq technology, an embedded solution for hardware design and software development suited for real-time operations and Linux based systems. 
With this technology, I managed to build a full-custom switching mode control system for power applications, by designing and testing components in a fully integrated environment.
Finally, I discussed the thesis on this project pointing out some topics, like the benefits of hardware parallelization for digital signal processing and the integration of hardware and software for real-time systems.
Now I'm looking for a place to start a career as electronic designer, preferably using embedded digital systems, where I can express creativity and apply knowledge to contribute on valuable projects.
